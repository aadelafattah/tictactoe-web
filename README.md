# TicTacToe

A basic TicTacToe game.

## Technologies

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, NodeJS and Yarn as the package manager, and snowpack as my bundler since I will be using node modules and dependencies.
For the CSS, I am using Sass because it extends the functionalities and capabilities of CSS.

## Algorithms

Loops to check which player won

---

### What comes now?

I wanna change the look and make the win button become a pop-up
